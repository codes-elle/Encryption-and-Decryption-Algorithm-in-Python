# Encryption and Decryption Algorithm in Python

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates a simple encryption and decryption algorithm using a shuffled character set. 

## Features

- Encrypts a given plaintext message.
- Decrypts an encrypted message back to the original plaintext.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/codes-elle/Encryption-and-Decryption-Algorithm-in-Python.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd Encryption-and-Decryption-Algorithm-in-Python
    ```

3. **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python "Encryption Algorithm in Python.py"
    ```

4. **Encryption:**
    - Enter the plaintext message when prompted.
    - The script will output the original and encrypted messages.

5. **Decryption:**
    - Enter the encrypted message when prompted.
    - The script will output the encrypted and original messages.

## How It Works

1. **Character Set:**
    - The script uses a combination of ASCII letters, digits, punctuation, and space.
    - The character set is shuffled to create a key for encryption and decryption.

2. **Encryption:**
    - Each character in the plaintext is replaced with the corresponding character from the shuffled key.

3. **Decryption:**
    - Each character in the encrypted message is replaced with the corresponding character from the original character set.

## Example

```python
Enter message you want to encrypt: hello
original message: hello
encrypted message: $m88&

Enter message you want to decrypt: $m88&
encrypted message: $m88&
original message: hello
```
